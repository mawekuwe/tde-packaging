  *** Changes to TDM conffiles:

  * Users upgrading TDM from 3.3.x, will find that TDM no longer uses the
    /etc/kde3/tdm/Xservers file, if /etc/kde3/tdm/tdmrc was updated to
    the version shipped with TDM 3.4.x. The package upgrade scripts
    will not remove Xservers even if tdmrc has been upgraded, if they detect
    local modifications. This should allow administrators to merge their
    Xservers changes into tdmrc before themselves removing Xservers. The new
    ServerArgsLocal key in tdmrc is where most old Xservers customizations
    should be placed.

  * Irrespective of the removal of the Xservers file, we highly recommend that
    all administrators accept the installation of the updated tdmrc file
    during the package upgrade. Many important changes to TDM's defaults have
    been made, and TDM is exceedingly bad at handling anything but the latest
    tdmrc format, so the nuissance of re-customizing TDM will likely prove
    less than the nuissance of dealing with a TDM that isn't working properly.
    If you have already upgraded TDM package without accepting the new tdmrc,
    purging and reinstalling the package should achieve the desired result.

  *** Changes to user login script handling:

  * Another important change that users upgrading from TDM 3.3.x may notice
    is that TDM's ability to source personal login scripts, long disabled, has
    been restored. The exact files sourced on login will depend on the user's
    choice of shell. For users of bash, TDM will source /etc/profile, followed
    by ~/.bash_profile or, if that is not present, ~/.profile. Note that TDM
    is NOT spawning a login shell, but is merely mimicking the behaviour that
    popular shells would exhibit if they were login shells, by manually
    sourcing the customary login scripts. /etc/kde3/tdm/Xsession controls this
    behaviour.

  * The important downside of the above approach is that TDM will utterly fail
    to start a user's session if the newly sourced files contain certain types
    of commands. For instance, many commands will cause the login attempt to
    fail because they expect an interactive shell, or because you are trying
    to "exec" something that cannot provide an X session. For instance,
    "exec ksmserver" will launch KDE, but "exec bash" will fail. Thus if you
    are unsure why TDM is refusing to start your session, try commenting out
    elements of the newly sourced login scripts, and you may find the problem
    resolved.

kdebase (4:3.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Users upgrading from KDE 3.2 might find that their keyboards seem no longer
    to work in TDM. This problem is caused by a change in KDE's handling of
    virtual terminals. The setting which puts TDM on vt7, which was contained
    in /etc/kde3/tdm/Xservers, has changed, and is also now located in
    /etc/kde3/tdm/tdmrc.

  * Users who, when upgrading to KDE 3.3, opted to replace their Xservers file
    with the version shipped by the package, but chose to retain their
    /etc/kde3/tdm/tdmrc file, will thus have a TDM configuration which nowhere
    contains a setting which properly places TDM on vt7. This can result in a
    race condition which has the end effect of breaking the keyboard when using
    TDM.

  * The solution to the problem is either to replace both of Xservers and
    tdmrc, or neither, when upgrading to KDE 3.3 for the first time.

  * Users already stuck can, after killing KDE, purge and re-install the tdm
    package, ensuring that the latest, fresh copies are installed.
    Alternatively, they can edit /etc/kde3/tdm/tdmrc and add the following
    line:

      ServerVTs=-7

    in the [General] section of the file.
