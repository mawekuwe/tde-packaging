 * play from a TV device (experimental)
 * show backend player's console output
 * launch ffserver (only 0.4.8 works) when viewing from a v4l device
 * DCOP KMediaPlayer interface support
 * VDR viewer frontend (with *kxvplayer), configure VDR keys with standard KDE
   shortcut configure window
 * Lots of configurable shortcuts. Highly recommended for the VDR keys
