Description: TDE Palm Pilot hot-sync tool
 KPilot is an application that synchronizes your Palm Pilot or similar device
 (like the Handspring Visor) with your KDE desktop, much like the Palm HotSync
 software does for Windows.  KPilot can back-up and restore your Palm Pilot
 and synchronize the built-in applications with their KDE counterparts.
