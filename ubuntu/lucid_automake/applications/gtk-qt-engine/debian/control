Description: theme engine using Qt for GTK+ 2.x and KDE3
 The GTK-Qt Theme Engine (also known as gtk-qt-engine) is a GTK 2 theme engine
 that calls Qt to do the actual drawing. This makes your GTK 2 applications
 look almost like real Qt applications and gives you a more unified desktop
 experience.
 .
 Please note that this package is targeted at KDE3 users and therefore provides
 a way to configure it from within KControl.
