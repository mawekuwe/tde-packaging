Description: File manager for KDE focusing on usability [KDE3]
 Dolphin is not intended to be a competitor to Konqueror, the default KDE
 file manager: Konqueror acts as universal viewer being able to show HTML
 pages, text documents, directories and a lot more, whereas Dolphin focuses
 on being only a file manager. This approach allows to optimize the user
 interface for the task of file management.
 .
 Features include:
  Sidebar
  Navigation bar (breadcrumbs)
  View properties remembered for each folder
  Split views
  Network transparency
  Undo/redo functionality
  Renaming of a variable number of selected items in one step.
 .
 This is the D3lphin fork of Dolphin, intended to keep development of
 the KDE 3 version of Dolphin active.
