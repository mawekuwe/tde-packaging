Description: KDE3 toys documentation in HTML format
 By default the modules provided by KDE only provide their documentation
 in KDE docbook format, which can only be read by Konqueror or KHelpCenter.
 This package provides all of the KDE toys documentation converted to
 HTML format so it can be read with any web browser.
 .
 The documentation will be installed into the usual directories
 /opt/kde3/share/doc/kde/HTML/<language>/<app>/, for instance
 /opt/kde3/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/amor/. Documentation is provided for most
 KDE toys packages.
 .
 This package is part of KDE3, and a component of the KDE toys module.
 See the 'kde-kde3' and 'kdetoys-kde3' packages for more information.
