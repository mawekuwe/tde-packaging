Installation:
*************
Use the Splash Screen Theme Manager in 'System Settings'->'Desktop'->'Splash Screen' to install this theme.
Be sure that your Login manager background is set to use the official Ubuntu wallpaper for consistency. This can be set in 'System Settings'->'Login Manager'->'Background'.

Using your own background:
**************************
1.Extract kubuntuUltraSplash.tar.gz
2.Open up your wallpaper in the Gimp and open the Dialog.png file included the "Source Images" folder as a new layer. 
3.Export the resulting image back to the UbuntuUltraSplash folder and be sure to name it Background.jpg.
4.Compress the folder as UbuntuUltraSplash.tar.gz and install it as normal.
5.Also be sure to change the 'System Settings'->'Login Manager'->'Background' to the same background for consistency.


***Users of 1900x1200, 1600x1200 & 1440x900. 
********************************************
If you have problems with your background being the wrong size, scaling incorrectly or fonts being too small or too big, do the following:

1.Extract the UbuntuUltraSplash.tar.gz
2.Rename your resolution specific background(i.e Background-1600x1200.jpg) to Background.jpg
3.In Theme.rc change 'BaseResolution =' to your monitors resolution. (This will prevent auto-scaling of background and fonts)
4.Compress the folder as UbuntuUltraSplash.tar.gz and re-install it.
5.Test the theme. If Label and Status Font sizes still need to be adjusted, extract and open Theme.rc, make changes to font sizes, compress folder & re-install.
