Description: digital photo management application for KDE [Trinity]
 An easy to use and powerful digital photo management
 application, which makes importing, organizing and manipulating
 digital photos a "snap".  An interface is provided to connect to
 your digital camera, preview the images and download and/or
 delete them.
 .
 The digiKam built-in image editor makes the common photo correction
 a simple task. The image editor is extensible via plugins and,
 the digikamimageplugins project has been merged to digiKam core
 since release 0.9.2, all useful image editor plugins are available
 in the base installation.
 .
 digiKam can also make use of the KIPI image handling plugins to
 extend its capabilities even further for photo manipulations,
 import and export, etc. The kipi-plugins package contains many
 very useful extentions.
 .
 digiKam is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
