qca-tls (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Most of the following changes were done by Peter Palfrader
    <weasel@debian.org> - many thanks to him!
  * New upstream version (closes: #235093).
  * qca-tls is a non-native package now (closes: #235084).
  * Clean up properly in clean target:
    rm -rf .ui .moc .obj Makefile conf.log conf.pri extra.pri
    (closes: #235089).
  * Do not copy over config.{sub,guess} from /usr/share during
    build.  They are not needed at all (closes: #235085).
  * Remove debian/qca.doc-base.EX example file (closes: #235092).
  * Do not ship readme in the binary package:  it's just install
    instructions (closes: #234939).
  * Something changed that makes the configure script make the
    Makefile install the .so into usr/lib, as opposed to usr/share
    (closes: #233530).  At any rate, we will not claim to have
    built a working package if it happens again:
  * Make the build fail if we don't have a
    usr/lib/qt3/plugins/crypto/libqca-tls.so file after install.
  * Make stamps in debian/rules actually work.
  * Update copyright file to list current download link
  * Added QMAKE_PROJECT_DEPTH=0 to .pro file to make qca-tls build in
    nested directory structures.
