Description: iptables based firewall configuration tool for KDE [KDE3]
 KMyFirewall attempts to make it easier to setup iptables based firewalls on
 Linux systems. It will be the right tool if you like to have a so called
 "Personal Firewall" running on your Linux box, but don't have the time and/or
 the interest to spend hours in front of the iptables manual just to setup a 
 Firewall that keeps the "bad" people out.
 .
 There is also the possibility to save entire rule sets, so you only have to
 configure your rule set one time and then you can use it on several computers
 giving each of them a similar configuration (p.e. school networks, office,
 university etc.)
