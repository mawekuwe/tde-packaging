Description: IDE for PIC-microcontroller development [KDE3]
 Piklab is an integrated development environment for applications based on
 Microchip PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers similar to the MPLAB environment.
 .
 Support for several compiler and assembler toolchains is integrated. The
 GPSim simulator, the ICD1 programmer, the ICD2 debugger, the PICkit1 and
 PICkit2 programmers, the PicStart+ programmer, and most direct programmers
 are supported. A command-line programmer and debugger are also available.
