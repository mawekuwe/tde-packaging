Description: an alternative to K-Menu for KDE [KDE3]
 KBFX is an alternative to the classical K-Menu button and its menu.
 It improves the user experience by enabling him to set a bigger (and thus more
 visible) start button and by finally replacing the Win95-like K-Menu.
 If you still want the old menu, because you're used to it, it is still
 available as an option in kbfx. We recommend, however, that you give the Spinx
 bar a try.
