Description: KDE image/slideshow viewer [KDE3]
 KuickShow is an image browser/viewer with a nice filebrowser to
 select images to be shown, slideshow support and the ability to
 display the following image formats: jpg, gif, tiff, png, bmp, psd,
 xpm, xbm, pbm and eim. Images can be displayed either in their own
 window, as large as the image, or fullscreen (which shrinks images too
 large to display). KuickShow also has a slideshow mode.
 .
 This package is part of KDE, as a component of the KDE graphics
 module. See the 'kde' and 'kdegraphics' packages for more information.
