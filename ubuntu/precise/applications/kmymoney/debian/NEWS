kmymoney2 (0.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * Due to licencing restrictions Debian is not able to distribute kmymoney2
   with HBCI (online banking) enabled, however you are allowed and can
   build your own with HBCI enabled!

   # apt-get build-dep kmymoney2
   # apt-get install libaqbanking16-dev
   # apt-get -b source kmymoney2

   For more information on this issue please refer to:
   http://bugs.debian.org/434278

   * Debian will endeavour to distribute kmymoney2 with HBCI enabled as
   soon as licencing allows.
