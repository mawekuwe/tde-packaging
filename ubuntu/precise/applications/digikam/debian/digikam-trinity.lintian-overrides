# libdigikam.so is no 'proper' shared library.  It's contents
# changes as needed. Upstream does not support any use beside
# for digikam and digikamimageplugins (that are released to-
# gether when the API changes). Therefore we did not split out a
# libdigikam and libdigikam-dev pkgs.  For further discussion
# see bug report #324592
