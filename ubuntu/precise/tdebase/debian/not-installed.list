The following files are not installed in any binary package.
This is deliberate.

/usr/share/apps/tdm/sessions/*.desktop
 - many .desktop files are not included since they either do not have Debian
   packages, or their Debian packages include their own .desktop session
   files for gdm/tdm, or they're not intended to be stand-alone window
   managers. Eventually, these should ALL be dropped, since they aren't
   really maintained upstream, and tdm isn't the correct place to ship these
   anyway. Here's the current list of those dropped:

   aewm++
   afterstep
   amiwm
   blackbox
   cde
   cwwm
   enlightenment
   fluxbox
   fvwm95
   fvwm
   gnome
   golem
   icewm
   ion
   kde
   larswm
   metacity
   openbox
   phluid
   qvwm
   ratpoison
   sapphire
   sawfish
   w9wm
   waimea
   wmaker
   xfce4
   xfce

/etc/trinity/tdm/README
 - useless comments, not intended for the end user.

/usr/share/fonts/override/fonts.dir
 - cruft, as tdebase no longer installs any system fonts.

/usr/share/apps/kappfinder/apps/Office/lyx.desktop
 - a lyx.desktop that works in KDE is provided by lyx-qt, so this just
   confuses users.

/usr/share/apps/kcmview1394/oui.db
 - this file is installed, but manually, in debian/rules, since the
   KDE build system can't be relied on to do it itself on !Linux.

/usr/share/apps/kcontrol/pics/energybig.png
/usr/share/apps/kcontrol/pics/lo-energy.png
 - It is not clear if this use is permitted under EPA's trademark 
   guidelines. See bug #441269.
