TDEFileReplace for Debian
-----------------------

TDEFileReplace is currently not available as a standalone application.
Instead it is made available as a KPart (an embedded TDE component).

An example of an application that uses the TDEFileReplace component is
Quanta Plus, found in the package quanta.
