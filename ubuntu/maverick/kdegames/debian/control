Package: kbounce-trinity
Architecture: any
Section: games
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Jezzball clone for the K Desktop Environment
 This is a clone of the popular Jezzball game originally created by
 Microsoft. Jezzball is one of the rare and simple games requiring
 skill, timing, and patience in order to be successful.  A ball begins
 to bounce off of an area enclosed by four borders (like a
 square). You must move your pointer to certain areas within the
 square. Upon clicking, a new border is constructed at a relatively
 quick pace. You can change the direction of the borders by 90 degrees
 as well. Ultimately, you must force the ball to bounce around in a
 smaller, and smaller area as time goes by without the ball ever
 touching the borders as they are being constructed. If a ball touches
 a certain part of the border as it is being built, the game is over.
 After 75% of the original space has been blocked off from the moving
 ball, you advance one level, and one more ball is added to the mix in
 the following level.
 .
 This game was previously known as kjezz.

Package: ksokoban-trinity
Architecture: any
Section: games
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Sokoban game for KDE3
 The first sokoban game was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi at
 the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. "Sokoban" is japanese for
 "warehouse keeper". The idea is that you are a warehouse keeper
 trying to push crates to their proper locations in a warehouse.
 .
 The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If
 you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places
 and/or block your way.
 .
 It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to
 make it even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves
 and/or pushes you use to solve the level.
 .
 To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), some
 collections with easier levels are also included in KSokoban. These
 are marked (easy) in the level collection menu. Of course, these
 levels can be fun for adults too, for example if you don't want to
 expose yourself to too much mental strain.

 i.e. it will fall down until it reaches the ground level or another
 stone. After a move is done it is the turn of the other player. This
 is repeated until the game is over, i.e. one of the players has four
 pieces in a row, column or diagonal or no more moves are possible
