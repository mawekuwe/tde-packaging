Description: dbus bindings for the Trinity Qt [TQt] interface
 D-BUS is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides bindings for the Trinity Qt TQt interface.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-BUS in general.
