Description: visual dialog builder and executor tool
 Kommander is a visual dialog building tool whose primary objective is
 to create as much functionality as possible without using any scripting
 language.
 .
 More specifically, Kommander is a set of tools that allow you to create
 dynamic GUI dialogs that generate, based on their state, a piece of
 text. The piece of text can be a command line to a program, any piece
 of code, business documents that contain a lot of repetitious or
 templated text and so on.
 .
 The resulting generated text can then be executed as a command line
 program (hence the name "Kommander"), written to a file, passed to a
 script for extended processing, and literally anything else you can
 think of. And you aren't required to write a single line of code!
 .
 As well as building dialogs, Kommander may be expanded to create full
 mainwindow applications.
 .
