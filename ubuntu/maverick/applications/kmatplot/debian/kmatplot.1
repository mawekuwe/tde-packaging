.SH NAME
kmatplot \- A Gnuplot-like tool for plotting data sets in 2D or 3D.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kmatplot

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents
.B KMatplot.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.B KMatplot
is a Gnuplot-like tool for plotting data sets in either two or
three dimensions. It can plot many types of 2d plots, including pixmaps
and contours, and 3d surfaces. It offers a full WYSIWYG mode with
multiple objects on a single page.

As opposite to Gnuplot,
.B KMatplot is very clickable, so easier to use for unexperienced users.
It can be used instead of Gnuplot with Octave and Scilab (although the
Debian package is not built with Scilab support by default) - there are
new dll functions installed in those packages, which communicate with
.B KMatplot
through a Unix socket. Those functions are named 'kplot', 'kimage',
kmesh', and are similar to those found in Octave by default.

Example plots can be found in the Help menu of the program. Help for
many of the Octave functions can be found within Octave, for example:
"help kplot", "help kaddaxes".
