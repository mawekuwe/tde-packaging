TDM manages a collection of X servers, which may be on the local host or
remote machines. It provides services similar to those provided by init,
getty, and login on character-based terminals: prompting for login name and
password, authenticating the user, and running a session. tdm supports XDMCP
(X Display Manager Control Protocol) and can also be used to run a chooser
process which presents the user with a menu of possible hosts that offer
XDMCP display management.

A collection of icons to associate with individual users is included with
TDE, but as part of the tdepasswd package.

The menu package will help to provide TDM with a list of window managers
that can be launched, if the window manager does not register with TDM
already. Most users won't need this.
