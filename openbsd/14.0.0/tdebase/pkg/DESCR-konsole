Konsole is an X terminal emulation which provides a command-line interface
(CLI) while using the graphical Trinity Desktop Environment. Konsole helps to
better organize user's desktop by containing multiple sessions in a single
window (a less cluttered desktop).

Its advanced features include a simple configuration and the ability to use
multiple terminal shells in a single window

Using Konsole, a user can open:
* Linux console sessions
* Midnight Commander file manager sessions
* Shell sessions
* Root consoles sessions
