TQt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. 
There are some user documentation files in ${TQT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt3-html package, 
or on the web.

There are database plugins: tqt3-mysql and tqt3-postgresql.

People who want to use tqt3 to compile applications outside the ports tree
should note that tqt3's installation conforms to OpenBSD habits, not
TrollTech's recommendations.
Accordingly:
- libs are separated from includes.
- moc is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/moc3, in order not to conflict 
  with other qt versions.
- uic is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/uic3

Generally, it's just a question of invoking 

env MOC=moc3 UIC=uic3 configure --with-qt-includes=${PREFIX}/include/X11/qt3 
	--with-qt-libraries=${PREFIX}/lib/tqt3

Or to force MOC/UIC in your make/gmake invocation:
make MOC=moc3 UIC=uic3
will override the Makefile contents.

Warning: the tqt3 library also appears under ${PREFIX}/lib, but you
*must* make sure your application sees ${PREFIX}/lib/tqt3 *first*, because
${PREFIX}/lib may also contain a later incarnation of Qt, in which case 
the linker will pick up the most recent library.
