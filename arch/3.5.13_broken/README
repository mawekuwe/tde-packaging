Those are PKGBUILDs for trinity components 
that won't build on arch because of various reasons.

I've out them here for archival reasons.

PKGBUILDs itself (apart for dependencies) are pretty
much finished for those.

After fixing and veryfing that they build pleas move
them to the 3.5.13 dir.

Problems with builds:
   kgtk-qt3:
      not our CMakeLists.txt files. Probably created
      by original KDE team (since it includes options
      for building it for Qt4). Cannot be build because
      of hard coded paths to tmoc. And uic-tqt.
      Fix for uic-tqt is included in the patch, but tmoc
      cannot be fixed. Maybe manually passing 
      -DQT_MOC_EXECUTABLE=/opt/trinity/bin/tmoc could help?
      Tried: cmake hangs after "--Found Threads:TRUE"
      message. Top shows 24 sed processes. Any fix?
      If it cannot be fixed, maybe whole CMake should
      be rewritten for this?

   knetworkmanager8
   knetworkmanager9
      CMake does not detect dbus-1-tqt. We provide 
      dbus-tqt-1, for which we pull tarball called
      dbus-1-tqt. It should be the same thing, but
      after chenaging Cmake instructions to search
      for dbus-tqt-1 which we provide, it still 
      fails.
      Patch provides missing cmake modules.

   kpilot:
      same as above (probably) plus "CMakeOptions.txt 
      not found! Run configure first." Error.
      Do we need kpilot? Is Palm devices supported
      by it still alive?

   kde-style-lipstick:
      not ported to CMake. Autotools TQt, Qt detection
      problems.

   wlassistant:
      not potted to Cmake. Same as above.
   
   rosegarden:
      same as kgtk-qt3. I think every else trinity component
      using CMake files wrote by KDE team won't work
      with trinity tmoc.
