Those are PKGBUILDs for trinity components 
that won't build on arch because of various reasons.

I've out them here for archival reasons.

PKGBUILDs itself (apart for dependencies) are pretty
much finished for those.

After fixing and veryfing that they build pleas move
them to the 3.5.13 dir.

Problems with builds:
   kgtk-qt3:
      not our CMakeLists.txt files. Probably created
      by original KDE team (since it includes options
      for building it for Qt4). Cannot be build because
      of hard coded paths to tmoc. And uic-tqt.
      Fix for uic-tqt is included in the patch, but tmoc
      cannot be fixed. Maybe manually passing 
      -DQT_MOC_EXECUTABLE=/opt/trinity/bin/tmoc could help?
      Tried: cmake hangs after "--Found Threads:TRUE"
      message. Top shows 24 sed processes. Any fix?
      If it cannot be fixed, maybe whole CMake should
      be rewritten for this?

   wlassistant:
      hardcoded incudes? Does not compile?
