Note on 2013/07/17 :

The stuff in this directory is obsolete.
It looks like it was an attempt to build TDE 3.5.12 on Mandriva 2010.2 .

The current TDE packages are built as follow:

For 3.5.13.x:
1) build "dependencies/qt3" from "mageia" directory
2) build all other packages from "redhat" directory

For R14 and later:
1) build all packages from "redhat" directory
