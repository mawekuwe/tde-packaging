This is a unsorted quick notes about TDE build issues, by distribution.

ALL DISTRIBUTIONS (or almost):
Some libraries are required but not provided by distribution anymore.
You can find them in "3rdparty" folder.

imlib1 : required for kuickshow
python-qt3 (also known as PyQt) : required for python-related packages (TDE 3.5.13 only, not R14)
hal : required for TDE 3.5.13.2, most recent distribution do NOT ship it.
wv2 : required for koffice


CENTOS 6:
ligogg-devel package is missing file '/usr/lib[64]/libogg.la'
Missing header 'jpegint.h'


MAGEIA 2/3:
Remove db4-devel and install db5-devel only.
Several version of postgresl-devel exist.
Ensure you have the latest one installed, or you will build against an old one !
MGA2: 9.1
MGA3: 9.2


MAGEIA 4:
Bug in /usr/lib[64]/pkgconfig/ruby.pc : missing "ruby_version:" value
Should be: ruby_version=2.0.0



CENTOS 4 / CENTOS 5
Some mandatory packages are missing or too old.
I had to build newer version in order to have TDE function correctly.
 curl (built as trinity-curl)
 poppler (built as trinity-poppler)


OPENSUSE 11.x and 12.x 
Missing cmake macros for RPM.
Manually copy file 'macros.cmake' from Fedora to '/etc/rpm'
Starting with OSS 13.1, the cmake macro is here.


OPENSUSE 13.1
Macro '%suse_version' has value 1230 instead of 1310. Need manual fixing.


OPENSUSE 11.4
Bug in 'libical-devel' package. (causes FTBFS in tdepim)
Edit file '/usr/lib/pkgconfig/libical.pc'
Then change as follow:
  Cflags: -I${includedir}/libical

To avoid relinking error on i18n (e.g. rpmbuild fails in amarok), create symlink manually on build system:
 for i in ar bg bn ca cs da de el en_GB es et fi fr he hi hu is it ja lt nl nb nn pa pl pt pt_BR ro ru sk sl sr sv ta tr uk zh_CN zh_TW; do
   mkdir -p /opt/trinity/share/doc/tde/HTML/$i/common
 done


FEDORA 20
kopete-otr: Missing 'libotr3' autotools macros. Need to put manually '.m4' file from source package in correct folder.


PCLINUXOS:
Many '.la' files are missing under '/usr/lib'. Need manual creation.
