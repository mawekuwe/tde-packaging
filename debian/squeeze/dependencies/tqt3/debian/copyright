This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the Qt GUI Development
library.

This package was put together originally by me, Heiko Schlittermann
<heiko@lotte.sax.de>, from the sources, which I obtained from
ftp.troll.no. The changes were very minimal to nothing, - merely
adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
various debian/* files and by changing the propagate script to fit the
Debian GNU/Linux filesystem structure.

This package has since been temporarily taken over by Ivan Moore 
<rkrusty@debian.org> until Heiko has time to work on it all again.

In Jul 2002, Martin Loschwitz <madkiss@madkiss.org> overtook the package 
maintenance for the QT3-packages.

This packaged is maintained inside the Debian Qt/KDE Maintainers Team
<debian-qt-kde@lists.debian.org> since Tue, 26 Jul 2005 19:06:03 +0200

Qt 3.3 is triple licensed under the QPL, GPL 2 and GPL 3.

It was downloaded from ftp://ftp.troll.no/qt/source
