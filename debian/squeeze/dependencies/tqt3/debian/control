Description: Qt development files (Threaded)
 Qt is a C++ class library optimized for graphical user interface
 development. This package contains the libtqt-mt.so symlink, necessary
 for building threaded Qt applications as well as the libtqui.so symlink
 and the necessary header files for libtqui.so. (See README.Debian and
 the Qt Documentation for instructions on libtqui.so)
 .
 WARNING: If you plan to build some older Qt3 applications, you will
 most probably have to install the libtqt3-compat-headers package. It
 contains all the headers which are not part of the official Qt3 API
 anymore but which are still used by some programs. So if you encounter
 problems with missing header files, please install this package first
 before you send a bugreport.

Description: Qt 1.x and 2.x compatibility includes
 This package contains header files that are intended for build
 compatibility for applications that build with Qt3 but still use
 deprecated includes. It is meant as an intermediate solution and
 these header files are not part of the official Qt3 API.
 All sourcecode that is still using the headers of this package is
 subject to be changed to use the new header files which are in
 libtqt3-headers.

Description: Qt3 Designer
 The Qt Designer is a GUI design program that interactively lets you
 construct user interfaces for the Qt library. Additionally it lets you
 create whole project and works together with the database drivers
 provided by Qt to create applications with easy database access through
 Qt. The resulting user interface files can then be converted to
 C++ classes using the uic commandline utility which is usually done
 automatically for the developer with a project management with qmake
 or automake.

Description: Qt3 Developer applications development files
 This package is intended for developers who want to develop applications
 using the additional static libraries that ship with the applications
 included with Qt; the Qt Designer and the Qt Assistant.
 It allows integrating additional enhancements into the Qt Designer
 respectively faciliate the Qt Assistant from within your Qt application
 to interactively call the Assistant for displaying online help that the
 developer includes with his application.

 This package contains the Qt3 Assistant, an easy to use frontend for
 the complete Qt3 documentation and serves as an online help viewer for
 any Qt program that wants to give the usesr access to online help.
 Within the Qt tools it is used as the help viewer for the online help
 for the Qt3 Designer and Linguist as well as qmake and the Qt 3 API
 documentation.
 .
 Developers of Qt Application who want to faciliate the Qt Assistant for online
 help display should refer to the README.Debian file for libtqt3-mt-dev and
 the package tqt3-apps-dev.

Description: The Qt3 Configuration Application
 The Qt Configuration program allows endusers to configure the look
 and behavior of any Qt3 application. It is mostly only necessary
 on systems which don't run KDE because the KDE control center already
 covers this configuration automatically for the users Qt3 applications
 according to his desktop settings in KDE. However, if you need to run
 CJK-fonts or other non-latin scripts, you will most likely want to
 install this package.

 application developers who need to migrate any Qt application written
 for Qt 1.x or 2.x over to Qt 3.x. The purpose of the tools are to
 help fixing the changes with include file renaming as well as migrating
 the message file format of Qt 2 translation files or any gettext-based
 translation system to the Qt 3 system.
