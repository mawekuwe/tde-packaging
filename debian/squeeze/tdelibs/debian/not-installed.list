The following files are not installed in any binary package.
This is deliberate.

/etc/xdg/menus/applications.menu
 - we install a renamed copy of this file (tde-applications.menu)
   to avoid conflicts with GNOME. See debian/rules.

/usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme
 - This is shipped as part of the hicolor-icon-theme package,
   which GNOME and TDE depend on. Shipping this ourselves would
   result in file conflicts.
