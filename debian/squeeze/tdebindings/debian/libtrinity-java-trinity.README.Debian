Developing and using TDE based applications written in Java
===========================================================

This document explains how to develop and use TDE based programs
written in Java.  This is what the TDE java bindings from the package
libtrinity-java are designed to accomplish.

Please read the document /usr/share/doc/libqt3-java/README.Debian.
Mostly everything mentionned there applies here as well, with the
addition that you should also add "/usr/share/java/koala.jar" to your
CLASSPATH for compiling and using (in addition to qtjava.jar, and
possibly others).
