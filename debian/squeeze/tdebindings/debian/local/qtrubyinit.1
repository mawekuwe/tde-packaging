.SH DESCRIPTION
Qtrubyinit is a wrapper around the ruby interpreter for executing Ruby
scripts using the QtRuby library.  It uses the tdeinit system to start
the app so that they start a little bit faster when started in a
running KDE session.

The script takes exactly the same options as the ruby(1) program.
Therefore, its options aren't documented here, please refer to the
ruby(1) manpage.

This script is part of QtRuby, which is part of the KDE Bindings
module.
.SH OPTIONS
Qtrubyinit takes exactly the same options as the ruby(1) program and
they have exactly the same meaning.  Please refer to its manpage.
