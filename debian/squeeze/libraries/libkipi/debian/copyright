    that accompany such Updates. If you do not agree to the additional
    license terms that accompany such Updates, you may not install, copy,

    Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this EULA, KDAB
    grants you the right to use the Licensed Product in the manner
    provided below.
    
    KDAB grants to you as an individual a personal, nonexclusive,

    designate another individual to replace the current designated user by
    notifying KDAB, so long as there is no more than one designated user
    at any given time.
