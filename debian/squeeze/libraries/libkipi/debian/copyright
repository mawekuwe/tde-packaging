    IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: This Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB End-User
    License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an
    individual or a legal entity) and Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB
    ("KDAB") for the Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB software product(s)
    accompanying this EULA, which include(s) computer software and may
    include "online" or electronic documentation, associated media, and

    copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and
    treaties. The Licensed Product is licensed, not sold.
    
    By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Product, you
    agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to
    the terms of this EULA, do not install, copy, or otherwise use the
    Licensed Product; you may, however, return it to your place of
    purchase for a full refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or
    otherwise using any updates or other components of the Licensed
    Product that you receive separately as part of the Licensed Product
    ("Updates"), you agree to be bound by any additional license terms
    that accompany such Updates. If you do not agree to the additional
    license terms that accompany such Updates, you may not install, copy,
    or otherwise use such Updates.
    
    Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this EULA, KDAB
    grants you the right to use the Licensed Product in the manner
    provided below.
    
    KDAB grants to you as an individual a personal, nonexclusive,

    time, but not more frequently that once every six (6) months,
    designate another individual to replace the current designated user by
    notifying KDAB, so long as there is no more than one designated user
    at any given time.
    
    
    GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES 
    KDAB grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and

    Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose
    of executing Applications permitted under this License Agreement that
    you have created using the Licensed Product.  Under no circumstances
    may any copies of Redistributables be distributed separately.
    
    The license granted in this EULA for you to create your own

    your customers is subject to all of the following conditions: (i) all
    copies of the Applications you create must bear a valid copyright
    notice, either your own or the copyright notice that appears on the

    of the Licensed Product; (iii) Redistributables, if any, shall be
    licensed to your customer "as is" (KDAB MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
    REPRESENTATIONS VIS-A-VIS YOUR CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT TO
    REDISTRIBUTABLES, AND KDAB EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES
    VIS-A-VIS YOUR CUSTOMER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN,

    arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of your
    Applications; (v) your Applications must be written using a licensed,
    registered copy of the Licensed Product; (vi) your Applications must
    add primary and substantial functionality to the Licensed Product;

    (ix)) you may not use KDAB's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or
