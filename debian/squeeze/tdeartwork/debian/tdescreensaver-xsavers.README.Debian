TDE Screensavers for Debian
===========================

This package (tdescreensaver-xsavers) only contains hooks for the standard
xscreensavers, so that they can be selected and/or configured through
the Trinity Control Centre.

For the additional screensavers that are specifically shipped with TDE,
see the separate package tdescreensaver.
