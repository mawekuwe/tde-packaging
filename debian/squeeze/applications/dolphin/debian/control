Description: File manager for KDE focusing on usability [Trinity]
 Dolphin is not intended to be a competitor to Konqueror, the default KDE
 file manager: Konqueror acts as universal viewer being able to show HTML
 pages, text documents, directories and a lot more, whereas Dolphin focuses
 on being only a file manager. This approach allows to optimize the user
 interface for the task of file management.
 .

  Navigation bar (breadcrumbs)
  View properties remembered for each folder

 This is the D3lphin fork of Dolphin, intended to keep development of
 the KDE 3 version of Dolphin active.
