  NOTE THIS ADD-ON
  .
  The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries
  in the first place. The LGPL has to be considered valid for this artwork
  library too.
  .
  Nuvola icon theme for KDE 3.x is a special kind of software library, it is an
  artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
  GUI.
  .
  Source code, for this library means:
  - raster png image* .
  .
  The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
  notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
  With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
  containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
  The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
  the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
