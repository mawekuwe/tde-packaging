TDE Screensavers for Debian
===========================

This package (tdescreensaver) no longer contains the hooks for the standard
xscreensavers.  It only contains the additional screensavers that are
specifically shipped with TDE.

To select and/or configure the standard xscreensavers through the Trinity Control
Centre, install the separate package tdescreensaver-xsavers.
