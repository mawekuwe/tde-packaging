kubuntu-meta (1.0) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add update.cfg for new germinate-update-metapackage (Build-Depends:
    germinate (>= 0.16)). Replace update with a trivial wrapper. We now pull
    seeds directly from bzr over sftp by default, so update will only work
    if you're in the ubuntu-core-dev team; run germinate-update-metapackage
    without options or temporarily replace "sftp" with "http" in update.cfg
    to update without authentication.
  * Switch to edgy seeds.
  * Seems like as good a time as any to bump to 1.0.

kubuntu-meta (0.56) dapper; urgency=low

  * Merged update script changes from ubuntu-meta:
    - Rewrite large parts of update to use germinate modules for Packages,
      Sources, and seed parsing; this allows us to take advantage of new
      seed syntax without having to duplicate code from germinate.
    - Build-depend on germinate (>= 0.6) for the above. This isn't really
      needed on the buildds, but you'll need it to run the update script.
    - Turn off HTTP caching while fetching seed lists.
