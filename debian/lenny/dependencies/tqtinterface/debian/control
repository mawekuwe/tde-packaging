Description: The Trinity Qt Interface Libraries
 The Trinity Qt Interface is a library that abstracts Qt from Trinity
 This allows the Trinity code to rapidly port from one version of Qt to another.
 This is primarily accomplished by defining old functions in terms of new functions,
 although some code has been added for useful functions that are no longer part of Qt.
