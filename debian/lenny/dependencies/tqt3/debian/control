Description: TQt development files (Threaded)
 TQt is a C++ class library optimized for graphical user interface
 development. This package contains the libtqt-mt.so symlink, necessary
 for building threaded TQt applications as well as the libtqui.so symlink
 and the necessary header files for libtqui.so. (See README.Debian and
 the TQt Documentation for instructions on libtqui.so)
 .
 WARNING: If you plan to build some older TQt3 applications, you will
 most probably have to install the libtqt3-compat-headers package. It
 contains all the headers which are not part of the official TQt3 API
 anymore but which are still used by some programs. So if you encounter
 problems with missing header files, please install this package first
 before you send a bugreport.

Description: TQt 1.x and 2.x compatibility includes
 This package contains header files that are intended for build
 compatibility for applications that build with TQt3 but still use
 deprecated includes. It is meant as an intermediate solution and
 these header files are not part of the official TQt3 API.
 All sourcecode that is still using the headers of this package is
 subject to be changed to use the new header files which are in
 libtqt3-headers.

Description: TQt3 Designer
 The TQt Designer is a GUI design program that interactively lets you
 construct user interfaces for the TQt library. Additionally it lets you
 create whole project and works together with the database drivers
 provided by TQt to create applications with easy database access through
 TQt. The resulting user interface files can then be converted to
 C++ classes using the uic commandline utility which is usually done
 automatically for the developer with a project management with qmake
 or automake.

 This package is intended for developers who want to develop applications
 using the additional static libraries that ship with the applications
 included with TQt; the TQt Designer and the TQt Assistant.
 It allows integrating additional enhancements into the TQt Designer
 respectively faciliate the TQt Assistant from within your TQt application

 This package contains the TQt3 Assistant, an easy to use frontend for
 the complete TQt3 documentation and serves as an online help viewer for
 any TQt program that wants to give the usesr access to online help.
 Within the TQt tools it is used as the help viewer for the online help
 for the TQt3 Designer and Linguist as well as qmake and the TQt 3 API
 documentation.
 .
 Developers of TQt Application who want to faciliate the TQt Assistant for online
 help display should refer to the README.Debian file for libtqt3-mt-dev and
 the package tqt3-apps-dev.

 and behavior of any TQt3 application. It is mostly only necessary
 on systems which don't run KDE because the KDE control center already
 covers this configuration automatically for the users TQt3 applications
 according to his desktop settings in KDE. However, if you need to run
 CJK-fonts or other non-latin scripts, you will most likely want to

 application developers who need to migrate any Qt application written
 for TQt 1.x or 2.x over to TQt 3.x. The purpose of the tools are to
 help fixing the changes with include file renaming as well as migrating
 the message file format of TQt 2 translation files or any gettext-based
 translation system to the TQt 3 system.
