qt-x11-free (3:3.3.8b-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * The previous implemention of the hack was still incomplete solution for
    restoration of [fl]?stat64 symbols on libtqt-mt.so.3 compiled with -O2
    against glibc << 2.7. In such a case, [fl]?stat64 were still inlined and
    not exported. Therefore, the hack implementation was extended to cover the
    latter case as a well and as result it should be fully compatible with
    m68k/unstable and backports.
  * Cleanup README.Debian: remove old information about non-threaded version
    of Qt3 and substitude contacts of previous maintainers with
    Debian Qt/KDE Maintainers (debian-qt-kde@lists.debian.org).
  * Drop 61_fcfontmatch_fontwidth_fix.diff patch. A bit different fix was
    applied upstream.
  * Add 61_eastern_asian_languagues.diff to fix font substitution for Eastern
    Asian languages under other locales (Closes: #468430).
  * Set urgency to medium because this revision fixes 3.3.8 regressions from
    3.3.7 and 3.3.8 has already entered testing.

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Suggest tqt3-apps-dev to tqt3-examples. Thanks to Matthew Rosewarne.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Make 01_export_stat64_symbols.diff hack glibc >=2.7 dependant instead of
    build depending on libc6-dev (>=2.7-1) and its other incarnations. This
    will restore Qt3 backports friendliness. Thanks to Pierre Habouzit for
    this idea.

qt-x11-free (3:3.3.8b-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Optimized Qt3" release.

  ++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Add 00_qmake_debian_compliant_release_target.diff patch to make 'qmake'
    release target debian policy compliant:
      - Use C(XX)FLAGS=-02 -g
      - Prevent qmake from striping binaries. Debian has dh_strip for that.
      - Patch configure script to build qmake itself with 'release'
        configuration too.
  * Build Qt3 using "release" build configuration.
  * Remove 01_stat_extern_inline_hack.diff and use different way of exporting
    [fl]?stat64 symbols because previous way is ineffective with -O2. Add
    01_export_stat64_symbols.diff patch for that.
  * The hack above depends on libc6-dev (>= 2.7-1). Adjust Build-Depends.
  * Add 73_configure_tquilt_compat.diff patch to make ./configure script ignore
    "project files" under tquilt temporary directory (./.pc/). I think that
    this problem was the cause of FTBFS on alpha & mips since *.pro files
    under .pc had to be `found` last in order for ./configure to succeed.
    Probably, this condition was not met on alpha & mips, but it was met on
    other arches.
  * Add myself to uploaders.

qt-x11-free (3:3.3.8b-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Re-add *stat64 symbols to Qt3 using 01_stat_extern_inline_hack patch:

    * the extern inlines from sys/stat.h are just gone, and that's just normal
      in fact.
    * /usr/lib/libc.so is a linker script that pulls /lib/libc-2.7.so _and_
      /usr/lib/libc_nonshared.a.
    * the latter defines stat64 and friends as weak-symbols and alises to
      __xstat64 and friends.

    That's how when you link something that uses fstat64 it finds the symbol at
    link time, letting you the possibility to override it with your own
    implementation.

    The fact that the extern inlines were used at some point in the past _was_
    a bug, and let tqt3 divert those, which should have not happened in the
    first place. Sadly, when you link against tqt3, it picks those symbols
    because it will always prefer symbols from a shared lib than from the .a
    IIRC, or it's due to the link order, anyways, it's not relevant.

    Thanks to Pierre Habouzit and Modestas Vainius. (Closes: #465028)

qt-x11-free (3:3.3.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Includes the fix to CVE-2006-4811, an integer
    overflow that might (in theory) lead to the arbitrary execution of
    code, particularly for those using KHTML (Konqueror's page rendering
    engine). Urgency is medium as this is a security problem.
    (Closes: #394313)

  * Add Hurd build patch, thanks to Cyril Brulebois. (Closes: #394195)

qt-x11-free (3:3.3.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin

  * Add a patch (accepted upstream) that fixes the use of some fonts
    with broken or atypical opentype tables. Some common Arabic fonts
    are affected.

  * Make READMEs and other docs available with libtqt3-mt (not just
    libtqt3-mt-dev). Also include the Immodule README.
    (Closes: #370742, #370744)

  * Patch the 11_qt_rubberband patch, to fix a crash and a signal bug
    affecting Kimdaba (and probably others).
    (Closes: #341982, #352409, #362155)

  * Add a hack to rarely used QFontDatabase code that avoids a crash that
    was causing KImageMapEditor to fail to start. (Closes: #369795)

  * Add /usr/share/tqt3/bin links for linguist, assistant, qtconfig, and
    designer (tqt3-dev-tools' binaries already have this).
    (Closes: #375888, #375887)

  * Include a /usr/share/tqt3/lib symlink for libtqt-mt.la. (Closes: #376954)

  * Build against libsqlite3-dev instead of libsqlite0-dev.

  * Temporarily version our build-depend on libxft-dev, to (>= 2.1.8.2-5.1),

  * Fix a new-for-3.3.5 QListView problem that was causing myriad random
    crashes in KDE apps. (Closes: #338002)

  * Build the InterBase plugin on amd64, now that firebird2 works there.

  * Move all .desktop files from /usr/share/applnk to /usr/share/applications,
    and ensure that they have Categories set. This cleanup also fixes the Qt3
    Assistant menu entry, which should now appear next to other Qt3 tools in
    the menu. (Closes: #335465)

  * Bump DH_COMPAT to 5. No changes retquired, except that the debugging
    package is renamed from libtqt3-mt-dbg to qt-x11-free-dbg, and contains
    debugging symbols for all binaries in all qt-x11-free packages.

  * New upstream release. Drop patches merged upstream, and sync those that
    remain.

  * Add a patch disabling 3.3.5's new use of includehints, since the
    implementation is still buggy and causing build problems for many
    programs.

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Move documention from tqt3-doc back to tqt3-designer and tqt3-linguist, since
    the last upload centralized it all in tqt3-doc. The reason for this
    inadvertent change was a years-old bug (just now noticed and fixed) in
    debian/rules, wherein portions of it would fail if sh where something
    other than bash. Add all the appropriate Replaces to cope with these
    moves. (Closes: #327291)

  * Revert the versioning of our build-depends on libpq-dev, since the fixed
    package has now built on all architectures.

  * Add a patch from the "Improving KDE" set that tweaks KDE's default GUI,
    changing some of the selection and highlight effects.

  * Revert the splitting out of the Qt style plugins, as this caused hassles
    for developers trying to create their own styles, and also problems with
    PyQt. (Closes: #327360, #328109)

  * Re-enable InterBase support, now that firebird2 has been built with gcc4.

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Add a patch fixing the generation of PostScript, which was broken due to
    a flaw in the code that only manifested itself with the GCC 4.0
    transition. This should fix printing in all Qt and KDE applications, as
    well as other glitches where nonsensical results were generated.
    (Closes: #326833, #326990, #327021)

  * No longer build non-threaded libraries. (Closes: #180326)
    No package in the archive uses them, except a bogus qtdmm
    build-dependency (#326627).

  * Add a libtqt3c102-mt-dbg package. (Closes: #235396, #322868)

  * Make the Qt3 documentation available from /usr/share/doc/tqt3-doc, and
    therefore also usable in dwww and doc-central. (Closes: #185900, #284407,
    #294630)

  * Apply packaging patches from Brian Nelson to allow Qt3 to co-exist
    with Qt4 packages. (Closes: #306879)

  * Apply 06_disable_rpath to linux-g++-64/qmake.conf as too.

  * Add the gtkstyle patch, in order to better support Bluecurve.
    (Closes: #316108)

  * Add more patches from qt-copy:
    + 29_qtc_fix_rotated_randr: Improve height/width calculations for rotated
      screens.
    + 30_qtc_qtoolbar_77047: Fix for the toolbar extension menu.
    + 33_qtc_qlistbox-crash: Fixes a crash that shows up in KHTML.
    + 34_qtc_dnd_optimization: Massive DND speedups.
    + 35_qtc_dnd_active_window_fix: Fixes DND when windows are changing focus.
    + 36_qtc_dnd-timestamp-fix: Suppresses needless popups when using DND.
    + 37_qtc_dragobject-dont-prefer-unknown: Fixes DND with some apps, like
      Mozilla.
    + 38_qtc_khotkeys_input_84434: Fixes keyboard input action in KHotKeys.
    + 39_qtc_qpopup_has_mouse, 40_qtc_qpopup_ignore_mousepos: Fixes the mouse
      movement and position affecting keyboard navigation with popups and
      menus.

  * Enable tablet support:
    - pass -tablet to configure.
    - add libxi-dev to Build-Depends.

  * Build jpeg support into Qt, not as a plugin.

  * Build the Qt styles as plugins. This does not affect the Qt buildkey,
    so shouldn't affect other packages.

  * Revamp the OpenGL linking patch. This fixes the loading of libXmu, a
    problem which affected some screensavers. (Closes: #296661)

  * Temporarily bump the libpq-dev build-depends to (>= 8.0.3-15), ensuring
    that we build against a version where the headers are located as expected.

  * The "Three transitions and one maintainer switch" release.

  * Cope with the following ongoing transitions in unstable:
    - C++ ABI transition.
    - X.org transition.
    - PostgreSQL 8.0 transition.

  * Move the package to the Debian Qt/KDE team, as agreed with the
    maintainer. Thanks to Martin Loschwitz for all his work over the
    years.

  +++ Changes by Adeodato SimÃ³:

  * Transition to the new C++ ABI. Rename all the library packages as
    necessary: every libtqt3c102-* goes back to libtqt3-* now. Changes based
    on the patch provided by Matthias Klose in Ubuntu Bug 10723.

    + debian/control:
      - renamed library packages.
      - add conflicts and replaces against the libtqt3c102-* packages, or
        change the existing libtqt3-* ones.
      - change the existing recommends and suggests on libtqt3c102-* to
        libtqt3-*.
      - adjusted descriptions where appropriate.

    + debian/rules:
      - s/c102// in various places.

    + debian/*.install, debian/*.links:
      - renamed as appropriate.

    + debian/patches/31_gcc4_buildkey.dpatch:
      - new patch picked from the Fedora Qt packages to ensure a stable
        buildkey accross compiler upgrades now that GCC 4 is the default.
        Kudos to Christopher Martin for finding about the existence of this
        patch.

    The above solves trouble for users when using tqt3-designer with g++ 4.0,
    so this upload closes: #317768.

    Also, disabling InterBase support has been necessary in this upload,
    because nobody has cared to make firebird2 not FTBFS with g++ 4.0. Dropped
    the libtqt3-ibase and libtqt3-mt-ibase packages, which can be reintroduced
    as soon as #317314 gets fixed.

      + debian/control:
        - don't build-depend on firebird2-dev.

      + debian/rules:
        - unconditionally use -no-sql-ibase and -Nlibtqt3{,-mt}-ibase.

  * Transition to the new X.org packages:
    + debian/control:
      - build-depend in libglu1-xorg-dev instead of xlibmesa-glu-dev; make the
        same change in the dependencies of libtqt3-dev and libtqt3-mt-dev.
      - add libxinerama-dev and libxkbfile-dev to build-dependencies; add
        libxinerama-dev to the dependencies of libtqt3-dev and libtqt3-mt-dev as
        well (closes: #319305).
      - add libxi-dev to the dependencies of libtqt3-dev and libtqt3-mt-dev. [cm]

  * Transition to the new PostgreSQL 8.0 packaging (closes: #317500):
    + debian/control: build-depend on libpq-dev instead of postgresql-dev.
    + debian/rules: invoke pg_config to determine the include directory.

  * Don't modify debian/control at build time, since doing it in the clean
    target it's a release critical bug now:
    + debian/rules: don't invoke type-handling to generate debian/control.
    + debian/control.in: removed.
    + debian/control:
      - adjust the list of *-i386 ports to list only the non-dead ones.
      - don't build depend on type-handling.

  * Overhaul arch detection in debian/rules:
    - use DEB_HOST_ARCH instead of DEB_BUILD_GNU_CPU to detect arm.
    - use DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU instead of DEB_BUILD_GNU_CPU to detect an i386 CPU
      (needs the new dpkg).
