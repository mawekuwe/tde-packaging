Description: an alternative to T-Menu for TDE [Trinity]
 KBFX is an alternative to the classical T-Menu button and its menu.
 It improves the user experience by enabling him to set a bigger (and thus more
 visible) start button and by finally replacing the Win95-like T-Menu.
 If you still want the old menu, because you're used to it, it is still
 available as an option in kbfx. We recommend, however, that you give the Spinx
 bar a try.
